# WorkTrack - Task Management System
WorkTrack is a full-stack Task Management System built using the MERN stack. 
It allows authenticated users to create projects and manage tasks efficiently.

## Architecture Overview

The application follows a client-server architecture.

- Frontend: Built using React (Vite) and Tailwind CSS.
- Backend: Built using Node.js and Express following MVC architecture.
- Database: MongoDB with Mongoose ODM.
- Authentication: JWT-based token authentication.
- Deployment:
  - Backend: Render
  - Frontend: Vercel

The backend is structured into:
- Routes → Define API endpoints
- Controllers → Handle request and response
- Services → Business logic
- Models → Database schema definitions
- Middleware → Authentication and security checks
